  * Travis CI integration

* `Pyramid`_: not done yet ...


Global settings
---------------

Some answers to bob's questions can be pre-filled based on global configuration
so you don't have to answer them every time. You can store this configuration
either on you local computer, or if you are working in a team, somewhere
online. We, NiteoWeb team, for example, have these answers always available for
us at http://www.niteoweb.com/mrbob.ini. The steps below also tell you to use
this configuration, but feel free to leave it our or provide your own.


Creating a add-on package
-------------------------

To create a Plone add-on run::

    $ mrbob --config http://www.niteoweb.com/mrbob.ini -O niteoweb.zulu bobtemplates.niteoweb:plone

and answer some questions::

    Welcome to mr.bob interactive mode. Before we generate directory structure,
    some questions need to be answered.

    Answer with a question mark to display help.
    Value in square brackets at the end of the questions present default value
    if there is no answer.


    --> Name of the package: niteoweb.zulu

    --> Version of the package [0.1]:

    --> License of the package [BSD]:

Your package is now ready. Let's build the development environment and see
if all tests pass::

    $ cd niteoweb.zulu
    $ make

Great, you are now ready to start Zope in foreground mode: ``bin/instance fg``.
Once Zope is up, point your browser to ``http://localhost:8080``, login as
``admin:admin``, create a new Plone site while selecting ``niteoweb.zulu`` from
the list of Add-ons and voil√°: a Plone site with your very own add-on
installed.

Now you can add some customizations to views and templates, or maybe write some
CSS and JS.
